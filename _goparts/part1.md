As a web developer, I use relational databases every day at my job, but they're a black box to me. Some questions I have:
- What format is data saved in? (in memory and on disk)
- When does it move from memory to disk?
- Why can there only be one primary key per table?
- How does rolling back a transaction work?
- How are indexes formatted?
- When and how does a full table scan happen?
- What format is a prepared statement saved in?

In other words, how does a database **work**?
